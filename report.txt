Summary
------------

At the moment, we have most of the Chess game complete.
There are some bugs such as some issues with en passant,
some issues with capturing pieces while in check, and
displaying possible moves while in check. We are also in
the midst of creating an AI that can access the our board
by being a friend class.

Goals
------------

In the coming weeks we can to achieve:

- Fully working Chess with no issues/glitches
- AI (?)
