We've all worked on the program 6-7 hours so far. Brian, Troy, and I have implemented the foundations of the game while David has written code that has successfully displayed the board and pieces so far.

We've realized that this program is going to be a lot harder than we thought it would be and are prepared for that. We now hope to have a working game in the coming weeks. After that, we'll start on the AI computer.
